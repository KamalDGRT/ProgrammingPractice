# Addition of First N Numbers

An enchantress disguised as a beggar woman arrives at a
French castle and offers a cruel and selfish prince a
rose in return for shelter.

When he refuses, she reveals her true identity.

To punish the prince for his lack of compassion,
the enchantress metamorphoses him into a beast and
she casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince
that the spell will only be broken if he learns to
write a C++ program to find the sum of first 'n'
natural numbers by recursion or else he will remain
a beast forever.

Write a C++ program to find the sum of first 'n'
natural numbers by recursion.

Can you help the beast to become Prince again?
