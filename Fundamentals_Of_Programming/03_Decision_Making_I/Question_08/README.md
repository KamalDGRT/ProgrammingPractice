# Gardening

Arya Stark of Winterfell is very much interested in gardening and she decides to 
plant more trees in her garden. She plants trees in the order of rows and columns.
She numbered the trees in column wise order. She planted the orange trees only in
the second column from both first and last. But later when the trees grew up, she
forgot where she planted orange trees. So help her find out whether the given tree

or "It is not an orange tree".
