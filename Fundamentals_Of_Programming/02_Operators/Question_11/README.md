# Ternary Operator

Working from home ,Joey Tribbiani is in a dilemma what to order for lunch. He was confused between Pizza and Sandwich. He decided to ask Chandler to tell a number and if it is even number, he will order Pizza and odd number, he will order Sandwich. But poor Joey! He was not knowing the difference between Odd numbers and Even numbers. Help Joey by writing a C++ program to get a number and find out whether it is odd or even. (HINT: A conditional operator is also known as ternary operator [exp ? true : false] which can be used to make an either-or choice).
