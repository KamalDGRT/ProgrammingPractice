# Wind Chill Factor

A wind chill warning for communities including Leh and Gulmarg, Kashmir, is forecast to remain in effect until 12â€¯p.m on December 12 2020. People were afraid to go out and were in complete lock down. Can you please help them to calculate the wind chill factor to help them?(Wind chill factor is the felt air temperature on exposed skin due to the wind. The wind chill temperature is always lower than the air temperature and is calculated as per the following formula. WCF = (35.74 + 0.6215t + (0.4275t - 35.75) * v^0.16).Write a C++ program to receive values of temperature and wind velocity and calculate the Wind Chill Factor.

### INPUT FORMAT:

The input consists of two integers. <br>
The first integer corresponds to the temperature of the wind and the second integer corresponds to the wind velocity.

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

The output consists of a float value which corresponds to the Wind Chill Factor.
