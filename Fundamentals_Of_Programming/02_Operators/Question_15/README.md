# Alice in Wonderland

Alice was bored because of the lock down measures and started sleeping. In her sleep,she started dreaming and she was sitting on the riverbank. Suddenly she notices a talking white hare with a digital watch. It ran fast, and she followed it down the hole. She fell into the hole and found a magical wonderland with dark trees and beautiful flowers.There she found many ways numbered from 1,2,3,........18. So, she was confused about the right way that will lead her home. She found a cute bird standing on one of the trees. Alice asked the bird the way to go back to her home. The bird told a two digit number(say 23) and asked her to find the sum of its digits (2+3=5). Further, it told that that numbered way will lead her to her home. Alice was already confused, so please help Alice in finding the route to her home.
