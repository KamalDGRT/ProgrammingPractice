# Special Number

Wil Wheaton who has filled in the shoes of Professor Proton
in the show Professor Proton Fun with Mathematics wanted
the kids to learn about Special number.

(A 2-digit number is said to be a special number if the
sum of sum of its digits and the product of its digits
is equal to the number itself.

For example, 19 is a special number. The digits in 19 are
1 and 9. The sum of the digits is 10 and the product of
the digits is 9. 10 + 9 = 19.)

Can you help Wil to write a C++ program to find all
special numbers between 2 limits m and n(both inclusive).
Assume that m and n are 2-digit numbers.
