# Data Mining

In the Hogwarts University examinations conducted during
the past 5 years, the toppers registration numbers were
7128, 80197128, 7678 and 6567.

Rachel Green is an expert in data mining and she could
easily infer a pattern in the toppers registration numbers.

In all the registration numbers listed here, the sum of
the odd digits is equal to the sum of the even digits
in the number. She termed the numbers that satisfy
this property as Probable Topper Numbers.

Now, write a C++ program to find whether a given number
is a probable topper number or not.
