# Viva on odd numbers

Amy Farrah Fowler asks her students to give 3 examples for positive odd numbers.

- When the student specifies a correct answer, his/her score is incremented by 1.
- When the student specifies a positive even number, his/her score is decremented by 0.5.
- When the student specifies a negative number, he/she will not be given any more chances to correct his or her mistake and his/her score will be decremented by 1.

So a student's turn comes to an end when he/she has correctly
specified 3 positive odd numbers or when the student has
specified a negative number. Some students didn't know the
difference between odd numbers and even numbers and they made
many mistakes and so it was difficult for her to maintain
the scores. 

She asks for your help. Can you please help her by writing
a program to calculate the score?

### INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
