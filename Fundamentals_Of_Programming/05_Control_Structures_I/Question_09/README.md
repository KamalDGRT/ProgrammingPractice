# Trendy numbers

Joey Tribbiani wanted to buy a meatball Sandwich and went to the
nearby sandwich shop. There was a poster which said that if anyone
comes up with a program for Trendy Number they can get lifelong free
Sandwiches as a gift. Can you help Joey to write a program to check

to be a trendy number if and only if it has 3 digits and the middle
digit is divisible by 3.
