# Chalk

Stuart Bloom's teacher Denise uses chalk to write on the board.
When the chalk reduces to 1/square root(n) of its original size,
she keeps the chalk aside as it gets too small. She joins all the

and uses it. If she uses one chalk each day, in how many days will
she use the given n number of chalks?
