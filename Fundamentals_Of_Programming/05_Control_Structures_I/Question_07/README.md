# Amoeba Multiplication

The Research team led by Bernadette Wolowitz at Cal-tech
University has discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the
order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are
exhibiting this amoeba in a national conference. They
want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time
instant. If a particular month’s index is given, write a
program to display the amoeba’s size. For Example, the
size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,...
will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.... respectively.

### INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:
