# Collatz problem

Phoebe Buffay started working for Chandler Bing and he
wanted her to write a C++ program to generate Collatz Sequence.

The rules for generating Collatz sequence are: 
- If n is even: n = n / 2
- If n is odd: n = 3n + 1

For example, if the starting number is 5
-  the sequence is: 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1

It has been proved for almost all integers, that the
repeated application of the above rule will result in a
sequence that ends in 1.

### INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

The input is an integer 'n' which denotes the
first term of the sequence. <br>
As output, print the numbers in the sequence and
also print the number of times the rule has to be
applied in order to reach 1.

### SAMPLE INPUT 1:

```
5
```

### SAMPLE OUTPUT 1:

```
5
