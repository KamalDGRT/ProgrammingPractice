# Remove duplicate elements

Sherlock and John were investigating a murder and the
murderer was Ms.Irene Adler.

She wanted Sherlock to find her by solving the
puzzles given by her and the tasks given by her.

Sherlock was able to solve all but one.

The last task was to write a C++ program to remove
the duplicate elements from an array.

Can you help Sherlock?
