# Functions â€“ Array Type

Write a program to find the type of array.

An array is said to be "Even" if all the elements
in the array are even.

An array is said to be "Odd" if all the elements in
the array are odd.

An array is said to be "Mixed" if it contains some
odd elements and some even elements.

### Input & Output Format:

Input consists of n + 1 integers where n corresponds
to the number of elements in the array.

The first integer corresponds to n and the next n
integers correspond to the elements in the array.

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.

Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications.
