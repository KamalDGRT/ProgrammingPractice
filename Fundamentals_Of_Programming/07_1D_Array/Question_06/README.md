# Stick Games I

After winning gold and silver in Indian Computing
Olympiad 2016, Tyrion Lannister and Jaime Lannister
want to have some fun.

Now they are playing a game on a grid made of
n horizontal and m vertical sticks. 

Let us assume a grid where, n = 3 and m = 3.

There are n + m = 6 sticks in total.

There are n * m = 9 intersection points, numbered
from 1 to 9.

The rules of the game are very simple.

The players move in turns.

Tyrion won gold, so he makes the first move.

During his/her move, a player must choose any
remaining intersection point and remove from
the grid all sticks which pass through this point.

A player will lose the game if he cannot make a
move (i.e. there are no intersection points
remaining on the grid at his move).

Assume that both players play optimally.

Who will win the game?
