# Stock Span

The stock span problem is a financial problem where
we have a series of n daily price quotes for a stock
and we need to calculate the span of stock’s price
for all n days.

The span Si of the stock’s price on a given day i
is defined as the maximum number of consecutive
days just before the given day, for which the price
of the stock on the current day is less than or equal
to its price on the given day.

Now, you need to find out the span values for the
given number of days and their daily prices.

For example, if an array of 7 day's prices is
given as {100, 80, 60, 70, 60, 75, 85}, then the
span values for corresponding 7 days are {1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 4, 6} .

### Input Format:

Input consists of n+1 integers. The first integer corresponds
to n, the number of days.

The next n integers correspond to stock prices on days 1, 2...n.

### Output Format:

The output consists of n integers that correspond to the span values.
