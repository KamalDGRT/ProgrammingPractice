# Array Range

Write a program to find the range of the elements in the array.

Range of an array is the difference between the maximum and
minimum element in an array.

### INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds
to the number of elements in the array.

The first integer corresponds to n and the next n
integers correspond to the elements in the array.

Output consists of an integer which corresponds
to the range of the array.

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.

Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications.

### Sample Input 1:

```
5
2
4
1
3
5
```

### Sample Output 1:

```
Enter the number of elements in the array
Enter the elements in the array
The range of the array is 4
```

### Sample Input 2:

```
3
1
2
3
```

### Sample Output 2:

```
Enter the number of elements in the array
Enter the elements in the array
The range of the array is 2
```

### Sample Input 3:

```
2
1
2
```

### Sample Output 3:

```
Enter the number of elements in the array
Enter the elements in the array
The range of the array is 1
```
