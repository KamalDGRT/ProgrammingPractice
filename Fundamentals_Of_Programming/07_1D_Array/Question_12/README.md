# Array Insertion

Arjuna and Karna were playing cards.

Arjuna has 5 cards.

Karna wants to insert a new card in between Arjuna's cards.

Karna wants to find the position to insert the card.

So help him to find the position to insert a certain card.

If Karna inserts a card in a position other than the
position of 5 cards, the game will be over.

So play carefully.

EXAMPLE:

For example, consider an array having three elements
in it initially and 

a[0] = 1,

a[1] = 2 and 

a[2] = 3

and you want to insert a number 45 at location 1

i.e. a[0] = 45,

so we have to move elements one step below after insertion

a[1] = 1 , 

and a[2] = 2 

and a[3] = 3.
