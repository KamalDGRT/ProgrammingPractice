# Array Mean

Write a program to find the mean of the elements in an array.

### INPUT & OUTPUT FORMAT:

Input consists of n+1 integers where n corresponds to the
number of elements in the array.

The first integer corresponds to n and the next n integers
correspond to the elements in the array.

Output consists of an integer value which corresponds
to the mean of the array.

Assume that the maximum number of elements in the array is 20.

Refer to the sample input and output for formatting specifications.

### Sample Input 1:

```
5
2
4
1
3
5
```

### Sample Output 1:

```
Enter the number of elements in the array
Enter the elements in the array
The mean of the array is 3
```

### Sample Input 2:

```
4
1
2
3
4
```

### Sample Output 2:

```
Enter the number of elements in the array

The mean of the array is 2
```

### Sample Input 3:

```
3
1
2
3
```

### Sample Output 3:

```
Enter the number of elements in the array
