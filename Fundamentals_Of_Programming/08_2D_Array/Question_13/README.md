# Diagonal Matrix

Diagonal Matrix is a square matrix which has zeros
everywhere other than the main diagonal.

Entries on the main diagonal may be any number, including 0.

Write a program to find whether a given matrix is a diagonal matrix or not.

### INPUT FORMAT:

The input consists of (n * n + 1) integers.

The first integer corresponds to the number of rows/columns in the matrix.

The remaining integers correspond to the elements in the matrix.

The elements are read in row-wise order, the first row first,
then second row and so on.

Assume that the maximum value of n is 5.

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print yes if it is a diagonal matrix.

Print no if it is not a diagonal matrix.
