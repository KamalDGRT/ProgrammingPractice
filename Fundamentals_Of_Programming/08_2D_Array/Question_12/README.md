# Magic Square

A magic square is an arrangement of numbers (usually integers)
in a square grid, there numbers in the forward and backward
main diagonals, all add up to the same number.

Write a program to find whether a given matrix is a magic square or not.

### Input Format:

The input consists of (n * n + 1) integers.

The first integer corresponds to the number of rows/columns in the matrix.

The remaining integers correspond to the elements in the matrix.

The elements are read in row-wise order, the first row first,
then second row and so on.

Assume that the maximum value of m and n is 5.

### Output Format:

Print yes if it is a magic square. Print no if it is not a magic square.
