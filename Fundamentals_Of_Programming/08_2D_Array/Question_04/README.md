# Lower Triangular Matrix

Snow White's father, the king, marries again.

His new wife is very talented, but she is a vain and
wicked woman who practices witchcraft.

The new queen possesses a magic mirror, which she asks
every morning, "Magic mirror on the wall, who is the
smartest one of all?"

The mirror always tells the queen that she is the smartest.

The queen is always pleased with that, because the
magic mirror never lies.

But as Snow White grows up, she becomes more talented each day
and even more talented than her stepmother.

When the queen asks her mirror, it tells her that
Snow White is the smartest.

The Queen asks the mirror what can be done so that she
become the smartest of all.

The mirror asks her to write a C++ program to check whether
the given matrix is a lower triangular matrix or not.Can you help the Queen to be the smartest?
