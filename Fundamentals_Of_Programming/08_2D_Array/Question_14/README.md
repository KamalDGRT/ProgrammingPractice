# Uniformity Matrix

Uniformity matrix is a matrix in which all the elements
in the matrix are either completely even or completely odd.

Write a C++ program to find whether a given matrix is a
uniformity matrix or not.

### INPUT FORMAT:

The input consists of (n * n + 1) integers.

The first integer corresponds to the number of
rows/columns in the matrix.

The remaining integers correspond to the elements in the matrix.

The elements are read in row-wise order, the first row first,
then second row and so on.

Assume that the maximum value of n is 5.

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print 'Yes' if it is a uniformity matrix. 

Print 'No' if it is not a uniformity matrix.
