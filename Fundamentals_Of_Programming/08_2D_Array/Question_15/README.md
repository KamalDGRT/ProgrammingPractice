# Symmetric Matrix

A symmetric matrix is a square matrix that is equal
to its transpose.

Write a C++ program to find whether a given matrix
is a symmetric matrix or not.

### INPUT FORMAT:

The input consists of (m * n + 2) integers.

The first integer corresponds to m, the number of
rows in the matrix and the second integer corresponds to n,
the number of columns in the matrix.

The remaining integers correspond to the elements in the matrix.

The elements are read in row-wise order, first row first,
then second row and so on.

Assume that the maximum value of m and n is 10.
