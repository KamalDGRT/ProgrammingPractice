# Transpose Matrix

Sheldon Cooper has a square shaped puzzle made up of small
square pieces containing numbers on them.

He wants to rearrange the puzzle by changing the element of
a row into a column element and column element into a row
element without altering the shape of the puzzle.

Help Sheldon to solve this puzzle.

Write a program to find the transpose of the given 2D matrix.
