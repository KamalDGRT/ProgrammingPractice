school. Now they are on their summer vacation. As they are bored, they 
ask their parents to take them to an exhibition.There Sansa and Daenerys 
play a game. In this game, there are three boxes with some number written 
on their top. There is a treasure in one of the three boxes and the 
treasure is present in the box with the second largest number on its top. 
Also, to open the box, they need to decode the correct code of this box.
