# Microwave Oven

Amy Fowler, a microwave oven manufacturer recommends to increase
the heating time by 50% when two items are heated and to double
the heating time when three items are heated. Heating more than
three items at once is not recommended. Now, write a C++ program
to find out the recommended heating time.

### INPUT FORMAT:

The first input is an integer which denotes the number of items. <br>
The second input is a floating point number which denotes the single item heating time.

### OUTPUT FORMAT:

Print the recommended heating time in floating point with 2 decimal places. <br>
If the number of items is more than three, print "Number of items is more". <br>
Refer the sample output for formatting.
